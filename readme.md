Nbox for XBMC Gotham 
====================

This is a small update of the Nbox skin for XBMC. The original developer never got around to making it compliant with XBMC 13 Gotham and beyond. Because I was using the skin on a daily basis I decided to make the necessary changes myself.

I am not a graphic designer and will not be tweaking any of the visual elements.

My thanks go out to
* **niamu** for creating this outstanding piece of work
* **DjCisco** for putting his fork of Nbox on [github](https://github.com/DjCisco/skin.BOX13). I backported some of his changes to this one.
* **XBMC Team** for making the open source media center software that powers my TV
